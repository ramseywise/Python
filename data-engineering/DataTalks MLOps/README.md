# MLOps Zoomcamp

## Overview

### Objective

Teach practical aspects of productionizing ML services â€” from training and experimenting to model deployment and monitoring.

### Target audience

Data scientists and ML engineers. Also software engineers and data engineers interested in learning about putting ML in production.

### Pre-requisites

* Python
* Docker
* Being comfortable with command line 
* Prior exposure to machine learning (at work or from other courses, e.g. from [ML Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp))
* Prior programming experience (at least 1+ year)



### Asking for help in Slack

The best way to get support is to use [DataTalks.Club's Slack](https://datatalks.club/slack.html). Join the [`#course-mlops-zoomcamp`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C02R98X7DS9) channel.

To make discussions in Slack more organized:

* Follow [these recommendations](asking-questions.md) when asking for help
* Read the [DataTalks.Club community guidelines](https://datatalks.club/slack/guidelines.html)
