# Machine-Learning

Assignments from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning and Deep Learning Courses in Python:

   - Machine Learning (Stanford)
        - Linear Regression
        - Logistic Regression
        - Multiclass Classification
        - Neural Networks
        - Regularization, Bias vs Variance
        - Support Vector Machines
        - K-means Clustering
        - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
   - Deep Learning (deeplearning.ai)
        - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
        - Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
        - Structuring Machine Learning Projects
        - Convolutional Neural Networks
        - Sequence Models

Code heavily borrowed from Mueller/Guido Introduction to ML as well as repos from kaleko, rranundez and andrewnoble.
