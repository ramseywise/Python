### Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables a computer to read, understand and process human language.

**How NLP works**

Current approaches to NLP are based on deep learning, a subgroup of AI that examines and uses patterns in data to improve a program's understanding. There are two main algorithms used to solve NLP problems:

- *Rule-based approach:* Grammatical rules created by experts in linguistics, or knowledge engineers.
- *Machine learning algorithms:* Machine learning models based on statistical methods to perform tasks after being fed examples (training data). 

**Benefits of NLP**

- Improves accuracy and efficiency when processing documentation.
- It has ability to: `read`, `classify`, `summarize`, `generate text`, `translate`, `extract information` and `sentiment` from texts.
